> If you think without writing, you only think that you're thinking.

We can communicate way effectively using modern technology nowadays. Having access to high speed
internet and cell phones has made it possible to send and receive information in a fraction of
a second. Using services like YouTube, Instagram and TikTok we can also share online content in
different formats. In such a digitalized world is it still necessary to write?

First of all you should realize that writing is not just for the sake of
communication. Putting your thoughts and ideas into words gives you way more than
simply conveying them to other people. But how else does writing benefit you?

Most of the time our mind is full of different ideas. These ideas are mostly vague and unclear.
We know that we want to talk about a topic, but we aren't exactly sure about
how to put them in words. This unclarity in thinking can cause many problems.

Writing can be seen as a process in which you pin down a single thought in your
mind and try to investigate the true nature of it. In this process, you realize
the things you don't understand and you attempt to understand them and gain a deeper insight about your own
ideas. Slowing down is one of the ways in which you achieve this. It is only in the process of writing that you truly discover what is it that
you're thinking of. Your previsoly fuggy ideas start to become crystal clear.

It can be concluded that writing is an immensely valuable activity. You may not gain a benefit from it
when you just start it out, but it is absolutely worth putting time and effort in it. So why don't you
consider turning writing into a daily habit?
